# electrification-paths-supplementary

This repository is part of the [UN Modelling Tools](https://un-modelling.github.io/).

This is the supplementary material used in this particular simulation.

Please read through the
[presentation](https://un-modelling.github.io/electrification-paths-presentation/).

You can find a running version of the visualisation
[here](https://un-modelling.github.io/electrification-paths-visualisation/).


## Results

In the Split Results file there are 2 tabs.

**Split results:** Includes the least cost technology split results
for each settlement, including coordinates, country code, projected
population for 2030, and technology results for 10 scenarios. Low
refers to current diesel price, while high to a projected diesel price
according to IEA New Policies Scenario for 2030. 1 to 5 refer to World
Bank's Tiers 1 to 5.

**LCOE results:** Includes the least cost levelized cost of generating
electricity for each settlement, for each scenario.

## Datasets

- **Algorithms:** Detailed information about the algorithm can be
  found at Mentis et al., 2015. The algorithms used in this analysis
  will be publicly available in an upcoming version of the tool.

- **GIS Inputs** for the scenarios can be found at the file "GIS
  Input". In the same file, one can also find georeferenced resource
  availability and costs for diesel and solar stand alone
  applications. Costs for mini grid and grid options are described
  further in Fuso Nerini _et al._, 2016.

Renewable Resource potentials are available upon request due to large
size. Please mail Dimitris Mentis at [mentis@kth.se](mentis@kth.se).

## Tranmission network

- Existing transmission network: Source: (AfDB, 2011; OSM, 2015)
- Planned transmission network: The transmission grid is assumed to
  expand to connect with planned power plants and mining sites (AfDB,
  2011; OSM, 2015; USGS, 2015).
